**Hi there** ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christine Wilks (she/her), a writer, artist and developer of interactive digital narratives and creative web apps. I'm also a practice-based researcher with a PhD in Digital Writing from Bath Spa University.

Iâ€™m currently working on **[Voices](https://writing-new-bodies.web.app/)** (beta v1.0), an interactive digital fiction for body image bibliotherapy (the practice of reading for mental health and wellbeing) for the [Writing New Body Worlds](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/writingnewbodies) research project.
